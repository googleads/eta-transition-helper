# ETA Transition Helper
An AdWords Script that exports standard text ads from an account to a
Google Sheet and then imports newly created expanded text ads back to the
AdWords account.

# How to build
run `./build.sh`

## Dependencies
npm (see https://nodejs.org/en/).

# Benefits
- Orders STAs by performance in the Sheet and automatically uploads ETAs to AdWords.
- Minimal learning curve (working with Sheets). Donâ€™t need to be a tech savvy to use it.
- Provides additional features to other bulk-tools: such as ad-preview and character count.
- Built on top of AdWords Scripts, no infrastructure is needed and can be used by all AdWords accounts.
